## Socially-Responsible AI for Computational Creativity<br>An Immersive Preview of CS Research

### Brown University / Google exploreCSR Program

Welcome!

AI is an area that is rapidly drawing student interest, and AI also pervades the news. However, this news coverage is often negative. Important conversations about hidden biases, deepfakes, and ``algorithms of oppression'' are raising awareness, but also might raise our doubts about whether we should study computer science! 

At Brown, we're interested in how AI can be used to realize *creative* visions, and to do so in a socially-responsible way. We have expertise in core AI topics such as multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and computer vision, and in adjacent creative topics such as AI-based computer graphics, interactive techniques for 3D creation, and computational photography/videography. Further, we're transforming our curriculum to place ethics at it core via our Responsible CS initiative.

To help you gain experience in this area, we are running a novel program that will provide you with *an immersive preview of CS research*. You will be offered a ``behind-the-scenes'' look at how CS research operates: to *normalize* research and remove its pretentions, and support your future careers as researchers. Each exploreCSR student will be paired with Brown graduate student mentors, who will help guide you through a research experience of your own. This experience will last at least one semester, over which you will build self-efficacy, practical research skills, and motivation to pursue graduate studies. At the end, you will produce an artifact, such as a literature review, or a reproduction of the experimental results in a published paper.

## Potential Projects

- With [Prof. Daniel Ritchie](http://dritchie.github.io/)<br>
*Structured Image Editing:* Many useful image editing operations are easy to conceptualize but difficult to edit, for example, changing the number of spokes on a bicycle wheel. In this research, participants would learn how to use "visual program induction" systems to convert images into structured representations that capture repeating patterns in an easily-editable manner.<br>
*Adversarial Shape Generation:* Machine learning systems have proven highly effective at classifying different types of 3D shapes: for example, a robot can be trained to tell whether an object it is observing with a depth sensor is a chair or a table. However, these classifiers are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which could be used for ill. In this research, participants would learn how to use AI to *generate* 3D objects that can fool such classifiers (e.g., generating a rifle which the classifier does not recognize as such) as well as how to make classifiers more resistant to this form of attack.

- With [Prof. Amy Greenwald](http://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/amy/)<br>
*Building AI to Play Games:* Building AI to play games as well as human masters has been a goal of AI ever since Arthur Samuel’s seminal checkers program in 1959. Today’s game-playing programs have surpassed human performance in substantially harder games, including backgammon, chess, poker, and Go. Still, in multi-player games, especially those played by embodied agents such as soccer, significant AI challenges remain. This project would involve the design and implementation of state-of-the-art AI agents that would ideally learn to play games that have not yet been solved.

- With [Prof. James Tompkin](http://www.jamestompkin.com/)<br>*Creative Deepfake Detection:* Systems to create deepfakes use complex machine learning to realistically synthesize face appearance. In this research, participants would learn about how deepfake systems work, and how they can be turned on their heads to detect fake images.<br>
*Mimicking High-end Photography:* Smartphones photos are good, but pale in comparison to pro equipment. In this research, participants would learn how we can use machine learning techniques to `bridge the gap' in quality between low- and high-quality sensors and optics, to help more people take beautiful photographs.

- With [Prof. Jeff Huang](http://hci.cs.brown.edu/)<br>
*3D Augmented Reality Sketchy:* Free-hand manipulation in smartphone augmented reality enables users to directly sketch in the air using their hands. However, human hands can ergonomically move in a broader range than a smartphone's field of view can capture, requiring users to be aware of the limited usable interaction and viewing regions at all times. Additionally, depth perception and feedback is challenging for drawing virtually. In this research, participants would learn what the experience of drawing in 3D is like, and experiment with interface and usability changes that can make it more intuitive.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- *Do I have a stipend?* Yes! We will support you with a small stipend for the duration of your experience.

- *Is the program all virtual?* Initially, the program will be 100\ virtual because of COVID-19; however, we hope to bring you to campus (with funded travel) to participate in [Brown's Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://cs.brown.edu/degrees/undergrad/research/symposium/) to showcase your work.
